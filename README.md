This repository contains data on student marks in three subjects, gender, name, age, IQ, and whether they have a part-time job.
Exploratory Data Analysis

You can use this data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer questions such as:

    Is there a difference in the average performance of boys and girls in any of the subjects?
    Is there a relationship between IQ and GPA?
    Are students with part-time jobs more likely to struggle academically?
    Are students of a certain age group more likely to succeed in school?
    What are the factors that contribute to a student's success in each subject?
    How can you use this information to improve the teaching and learning process?

# Steps to perform EDA

Here are some steps you can follow to perform EDA on the student data:

    Load the data into a statistical software package such as Python, R, or SPSS.
    Calculate descriptive statistics for each variable, such as the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.
    Create visualizations of the data, such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
    Compare the performance of different groups of students, such as boys vs. girls, students with part-time jobs vs. students without part-time jobs, and students of different age groups.
    Calculate the correlation between the different variables in the data.
    Use regression analysis to model the relationship between the different variables in the data.

# Insights

Once you have performed EDA on the student data, you can use the insights you have gained to improve the teaching and learning process. For example, you might find that students of a certain age group are struggling with a particular concept. You can then provide additional instruction on that concept to this group of students.
Conclusion

EDA is a powerful tool that can be used to gain valuable insights into student data and improve the teaching and learning process.
