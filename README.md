# DSC_TECH ( AKSHIT OHRI )

This repository contains data on student marks in three subjects (math, reading, and writing), gender, name, age, IQ, whether they have a part-time job, and their parental level of education.
Exploratory Data Analysis

You can use this data to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer questions such as:

    Is there a difference in the average performance of boys and girls in any of the subjects?
    Is there a relationship between IQ and GPA?
    Are students with part-time jobs more likely to struggle academically?
    Are students of a certain age group more likely to succeed in school?
    Do students with parents with higher levels of education tend to perform better academically?
    What are the factors that contribute to a student's success in each subject?
    How can you use this information to improve the teaching and learning process?


# What is EDA 

There are four main types of EDA:

    Univariate EDA: Univariate EDA involves looking at a single variable at a time. This can help you understand the distribution of the data and identify any outliers.
    Bivariate EDA: Bivariate EDA involves looking at two variables at a time. This can help you understand the relationship between two variables and identify any patterns that might exist.
    Multivariate EDA: Multivariate EDA involves looking at three or more variables at a time. This can help you understand the complex relationships between different variables.
    Visual EDA: Visual EDA involves using data visualization tools to create charts and graphs that help you see the data in a new way. This can help you identify patterns and trends that might be difficult to see in the raw data.

You can use a combination of these different types of EDA to get a complete understanding of your data.

Here are some examples of EDA techniques:

    Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics, such as the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range, can be used to summarize the data and identify any outliers.
    Data visualization: Data visualization tools, such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots, can be used to create charts and graphs that help you see the data in a new way. This can help you identify patterns and trends that might be difficult to see in the raw data.
    Group comparisons: You can compare the performance of different groups of students, such as boys vs. girls, students with part-time jobs vs. students without part-time jobs, and students of different age groups. This can help you identify any factors that are associated with academic success.
    Correlation analysis: Correlation analysis can be used to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. This can help you identify any relationships between the variables that you can then investigate further.
    Regression analysis: Regression analysis can be used to model the relationship between two or more variables. This can help you predict the value of one variable based on the values of other variables.

You can use these different EDA techniques to answer a wide range of questions about your data. For example, you can use EDA to:

    Identify the factors that contribute to student success in each subject.
    Develop targeted interventions to help all students reach their full potential.
    Improve the teaching and learning process.


# Steps to perform EDA

Here are some steps you can follow to perform EDA on the student data:

    Load the data into a statistical software package such as Python.
    Calculate descriptive statistics for each variable, such as the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.
    Create visualizations of the data, such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
    Compare the performance of different groups of students, such as boys vs. girls, students with part-time jobs vs. students without part-time jobs, students of different age groups, and students with parents with different levels of education.
    Calculate the correlation between the different variables in the data.
    Use regression analysis to model the relationship between the different variables in the data.


# Insights

Once you have performed EDA on the student data, you can use the insights you have gained to improve the teaching and learning process. For example, you might find that students with part-time jobs are struggling in math. You can then provide additional support to these students in math class. You might also find that students with parents with higher levels of education tend to perform better in reading. You can then focus on providing these students with more challenging reading material.

Here are some insights : 

    You might find that there is a gender gap in math performance, with boys outperforming girls. You can then develop strategies to help girls improve their math performance, such as providing them with more opportunities to practice math problems in class and at home.
    
    You might find that students with part-time jobs are more likely to struggle in reading. You can then provide these students with additional support in reading class, such as giving them extra time to complete assignments and allowing them to read books during their free time.
    
    You might find that students with parents with higher levels of education tend to perform better in writing. You can then encourage these students to participate in extracurricular writing activities, such as the school newspaper or literary magazine.

Conclusion

EDA is a powerful tool that can be used to gain valuable insights into student data and improve the teaching and learning process. By using EDA to identify the factors that contribute to student success, you can develop targeted interventions to help all students reach their full potential.
